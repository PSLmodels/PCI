What is the Policy Change Index for China (PCI-China)?
-----------------------------------------------
China's industrialization process has long been a product of government direction, be it coercive central planning or ambitious industrial policy. For the first time in the literature, we develop a quantitative indicator of China's policy priorities over a long period of time, which we call the Policy Change Index for China (PCI-China). The PCI-China is a leading indicator that runs from 1951 to the most recent quarter and can be updated in the future. In other words, the PCI-China not only helps us understand the past of China's industrialization but also allows us to make short-term predictions about its future directions.

The design of the PCI-China has two building blocks: (1) it takes as input data the full text of the *People's Daily* --- the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China --- since it was founded in 1946; (2) it employs a set of machine learning techniques to "read" the articles and detect changes in the way the newspaper prioritizes policy issues.

The source of the PCI-China's predictive power rests on the fact that the *People's Daily* is at the nerve center of the China's propaganda system and that propaganda changes often precede policy changes. Before the great transformation from the central planning under Mao to the economic reform program after Mao, for example, considerable efforts were made by the Chinese government to promote the idea of reform, move public opinion, and mobilize resources toward the new agenda. Therefore, by detecting (real-time) changes in propaganda, the PCI-China is, effectively, predicting (future) changes in policy.

For details about the methodology and findings of this project, please see the following research paper:

AEI Economics Working Paper [No. 2018-11](http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reading-China-AEI-WP.pdf) (latest version available [here](https://policychangeindex.org/Reading_China.pdf)).


Disclaimer
----------
Results will change as the underlying models improve. A fundamental reason for adopting open source methods in this project is so that people from all backgrounds can contribute to the models that our society uses to assess and predict changes in public policy; when community-contributed improvements are incorporated, the model will produce better results.


Getting Started
---------------
The first step for everyone (users and developers) is to open a free GitHub account. And then you can specify how you want to "watch" the PCI-China repository by clicking on the Watch button in the upper-right corner of the repository's main page.

The second step is to get familiar with the PCI-China repository by reading the documentation.

If you want to ask a question or report a bug, create a new issue [here](https://github.com/PSLmodels/PCI-China/issues) and post your question or tell us what you think is wrong with the repository.

If you want to request an enhancement, create a new issue [here](https://github.com/PSLmodels/PCI-China/issues) and provide details on what you think should be added to the repository.


Installation Guide
---------------
Run the following command in the shell.

```{shell}
./PCI-China>sh run_all.sh
```

The command will perform the following tasks: (1) processing data, (2) training models for two-, five-, and ten-year rolling windows, (3) compiling results, (4) creating text output, and (5) visualizing results.


Function Usage
---------------
The python and an R script listed below are contained in the `run_all.sh` file. They are available for users to perform the following tasks, respectively.

- `proc_pd.py`:             Process and prepare the raw data from the *People's Daily* for building the neural network models.
- `pci.py`:                 Train a neural network model to construct the PCI-China for a specified year-quarter, using a specified rolling window length.
- `compile_tuning.py`:      Compile the results from all models and export them to a `.csv` file.
- `create_text_output.py`:  Generate the raw data together with the model's classification result for each article in a specified year-quarter.
- `gen_figures.R`:          Generate figures.
- `create_plotly.py`:       Create an interactive Plotly fiture.

For the `pci.py` file, users can also check out the descriptions of the arguments for the function using the `--help` option:

```{shell}
./PCI-China>python pci.py --help
Using TensorFlow backend.
usage: pci.py [-h] [--model MODEL] [--year YEAR] [--month MONTH] [--gpu GPU]

                        Bandwidth in simulated annealing
```


Data
----
The raw data of the *People's Daily*, which are not provided in this repository, should be placed in the sub-folder `PCI-China/Input/pd/`. Each file in this sub-folder should contain one year-quarter of data, be named by the respective year-quarter, and be in the `.pkl` format. For example, the raw data for the first quarter of 2018 should be in the file `2018_Q1.pkl`. Below is the list of column names and types of each raw data file:

```{python}
>>> df1 = pd.read_pickle("./PCI-China/Input/pd/pd_1946_1975.pkl")
>>> df1.dtypes
date     datetime64[ns]
year              int64
month             int64
day               int64
page              int64
title            object
body             object
id                int64
dtype: object
```

where `title` and `body` are the Chinese texts of the title and body of each article.

The processed data of the *People's Daily*, which are not provided in this repository, should be placed in the sub-folder `PCI-China/data/Output/database.db`. The file is in SQLite format. The schema of the database is shown as the table below

```{python}
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd 

conn = sqlite3.connect("data/output/database.db")
pd.read_sql_query("PRAGMA TABLE_INFO(main)", conn)
```
